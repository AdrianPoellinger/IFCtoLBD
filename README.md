# IFCtoLBD
This repository presents the results of our ongoing work to 
create a usable converter to convert  
Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) STEP formatted files into 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples that follow the small ontologies devised in  the  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG)
(https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/).

The precompiled desktop application, IFCtoLBD-Desktop.jar, is available at this page. It is a runnable JAR-file. It is recommended to run the JAR using Java JDK version 8 that can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html .  If the Java installation is fine, the file can be run by clicking it. If not, try the following command at the command line: "java -jar IFCtoLBD-Desktop.jar".
